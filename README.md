# Migration Intelligence analysis - UIDAI Hackathon 2026

## Project Overview
This analysis detects population movement by analyzing Aadhaar enrolment anomalies. We specifically track "High Velocity" spikes where district activity jumps from zero to massive volumes, indicating new settlements.

## Key Findings
- **Top Hotspot:** Murshidabad, West Bengal (13,877 new enrolments in Sept 2025).
- **Trend:** Significant migration clusters detected in West Bengal border districts and Gujarat industrial zones.
